### ðŸ¤” Why this mod?
When you feel like you default difficulty for every run is `Insane` mode then `Insane` is no longer serving its purpose. This mod aim's to fix that for crews that are fully perked in their trees.

It leverages game's existing difficulty setting and remaps it so `Expert` ( which is the game's actual baseline difficulty!) becomes `Normal`, old `Insane` becomes `Veteran` and adds new multipliers for proper challenging `Expert` and `Insane` difficulties.

If you have DRG background, think of this as Hazard 4 on modded `Expert` and Hazard 5 on `Insane`.
