# Void Crew Mods by Maverik

This repo contains various mods that I've made for [Void Crew](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1063420/Void_Crew/) and the code is shared in spirit of sharing my work with the community as long as the terms of the License: [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) are clearly honoured.

&nbsp;

### üìÉ Prerequisite

This is a [BepInEx 5](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) mod and as such requires that you have BepInEx 5 installed and working properly. If you've not done that yet, please go to their [documentation](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html) on how to get it installed. 

You want the Stable (5.x - 5.4.22 LTS at the time of writing) **MONO** build when you're presented with choices.

If you already know how to get BepInEx working, head over to their [Releases](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) to grab the latest copy.


### üëå Recommended

My mods support configuration through [BepInEx Configuration Manager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager) and I'd recommend you grabbing that as well to be able to tweak the mod to your own tastes.


### ‚úîÔ∏è Mod install

So you've got a working BepInEx 5 Mono installation running successfully. Now you can build this repo and the plugins will be automatically staged into your game folder.

You should find the mod installed under `Bepinex\plugins\MavsPlugins`.
