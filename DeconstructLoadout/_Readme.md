### 🤔 Why this mod?

While there are other variations of this mod that have been shared on discord, the unique thing about my mod is that it actually deconstructs the load out items by asking the game to do it on your behalf rather than editing a deconstruction mechanism directly into the slot.

### 💡With this Mod

- You don't have to wait on the host to deconstruct things or worse waste ammo because you did not know host was planning to move the gun.
- It's a lot more resistant to breaking between updates as I'm not editing the game object directly. I simply prevent the game from marking the load out item as permanent fixture and then as it deconstructs, it automatically becomes a normal object that anyone can use.

### ⚠️ Do not mix with other deconstruction mods

This should go without saying if you've ready any of the above, but you should never have overlapping mods that touch the same part of game.
