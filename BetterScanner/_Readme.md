### ðŸ¤” Why this mod?

As with most things in base game, our helm scanner seems like it never left the handheld transceiver age. Well let's fix that!

### ðŸ’¡With this Mod

- The pilot (whoever is running this mod & sitting in the chair) can scan anything in 10km range by default over the base range of 3km. No longer do you have to wonder if that blip in the blinding sun is a collector or a bomber.
- The ship itself is now more aware of it's surroundings and will passively scan threats closing in on it from 750m onwards, up from 150m base.
