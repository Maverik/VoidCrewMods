### ðŸ¤” Why this mod?

As with most things in base game, our helm scanner seems like it never left the handheld transceiver age. Well let's fix that!

### ðŸ’¡With this Mod

- The pilot (whoever is running this mod & sitting in the chair) can scan anything in 10km range by default up from 3km base. No longer do you have to wonder if that blip in the blinding sun is a collector or a bomber.
- The ship itself is now more aware of it's surroundings and will passively scan threats closing in on it from 750m onwards, up from 150m base.

### ðŸ“€ Runs on

- âœ… Host
  - If you're the host & the one piloting the ship, this is all you need.
- â¬œ Client
- âœ… Both
  - If you're **not** the host but the one piloting, then you both need it.
  - You need it as a `Client` to activate the scan button.
  - The `Host` needs to have this mod installed to actually do the scanning with the ship. The game only sends a request for scanning to host and you don't carry out the scan yourself as the joining player.
