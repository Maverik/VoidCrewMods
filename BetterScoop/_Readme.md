### 🤔 Why this mod?

Ask any pilot and they will tell you the frustration of trying to scoop the loot in middle of the combat. What's worse is that you can create infinite tether, if you're boosting and turning. Eventually, if you turn the scoop off to reset, you'll send items flying into the sun. If you've never experienced this, count yourself lucky! 

### ❕Defaults
The default scoop has as a pull range of about the size of a destroyer length roughly speaking which really isn't a lot. It's barely responsive and is just outright unusable if you are using my Higher Difficulty mod.

### 💡With this Mod
The scoop gains powers that make it a pleasure to use finally.

- It is a lot more responsive.
- It has a range of 750m before engineer boost (you really shouldn't boost it unless you really need to like trying to find loot you can't spot easily).
- It has enough pull velocity to keep up with a boosting ship with a fully perked pilot.
- It doesn't need resetting every two minutes. If it's not pulling its because it's full not because it's stuck (generally speaking).

Once you start using this, you'll wonder how is this not part of the game already 😄
