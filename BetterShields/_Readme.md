### ðŸ¤” Why this mod?

Ever since the nerf in recent patch, shields have been pretty useless resulting in people stacking shields all over the place. What's worse is that people also don't understand the diminishing returns mechanism resulting from the nerf.

This mod returns the shields to their former glory and then makes them worth of the space age!

### ðŸ’¡With this Mod

- This shields now absorb as much damage as they can before letting the remaining damage through.
- The shields now boast 25 damage absorption per shield rather than 10 in base game.
- The ship now comes with built-in shield that will absorb stray hits and regenerates over time on its own and cannot be boosted like regular shields with cells.
- The shields now charge at 1.5 hp per tick instead of 1 per tick to compensate for the extra HP on them.
- Since these are powerful shields, they take longer time to recharge again going from 5 seconds of delay to 7.5 seconds of delay.
