#### 🤔 Why this mod?

Actually you shouldn't be installing it unless you're doing a manual install and that mod you in the store that it needs this library (all my mods will need this library).

This is not meant to be used alone and you should not install it if you haven't been asked to by another mod.

#### ⚠️ Note for developers

This library configures the BepInEx to turn on `HideManagerObject`. 

If you're one of the exceptions who rely on getting manager object destroyed right at the start of the game, this flag is going to break it for you.

At the time of writing, no one is known to rely on this behaviour and it is not something you should be relying on in a well behaved mod.
